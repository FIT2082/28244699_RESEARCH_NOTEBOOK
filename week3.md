# Week 3

This week our main task is to get a better understanding of the project and get a better understanding of 
unity. 

## Meeting
 
I was unable to attend this meeting however I did have conversation with Jason about what was discussed in
 the meeting. The first thing that was established was a time for our weekly meetings, it was decide that we 
 would all meet at 1030 every Monday morning. Since our project is related to the project being done by Hailleslassie 
 and Timothy it was decided that we can work together on some aspects of our project and our supervisors felt it 
 would be beneficial for us to have the meetings together.
