# Week 12

No meeting was scheduled this weeks however we spent or week finalizing the poster and I got feedback from our supervisor 
who suggested that we add more explanation of how the teleportation methods work however overall he was pleased with the 
structure and content of the poster. With the advice from the our supervisors and the results of our evalution Jason and 
I finalized our poster which may be found here https://github.com/FIT2082/28244699_RESEARCH_NOTEBOOK/blob/master/Final%20Draft.pdf

## Meeting

No meeting this week 

## Evaluation 

From our heuristic  evaluation we found that:
 * **Walking in VR was rated the highest** 
 * teleportation by pointing and teleportation by using a map and portal did not perform as badly as expected 

As expected walking in VR was the easiest to use as it mimics real life walking.
## Final remarks 

* Although the final prototype was a bit buggy all the aims set up in the project specification were mostly achived
* It would have been more ideal to have a better model as a lot of time was spent trying to fix the old model
* More development should have been done using the Vive to avoid some of the bugs we encountered 
* Due to time constraints we had to limit the techniques we wanted to test it would be more ideal in the future to
fully explore more navigation techniques.
* The heuristic evaluation would benefit from having a larger sample space especially people with varying expirence in VR
to get a more representative result
