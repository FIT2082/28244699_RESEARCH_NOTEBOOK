# Week 7

This week I continued working on trying to clean up the mesh with very little success, I decided to switch to Maya 
instead of Blender however Maya is very complex and I am still learning how to fix the model. I also talked to Jason 
who also shared with me the frustrations he had been having with the model so be cause the model had a lot 
of holes in it all the basic Navigation techniques he'd implements would result with user usually falling somewhere 
in space so the problem of the model is clearly hindering our progress and we discussed ways in which we 
could fix it. We managed to create the repository and upload the files.Arnaud invited jason and I to be part of his 
user study for a project in Visualization of Data in VR this was a very exciting experience and Jason and managed 
to get some first hand experience with the technology we would be working with.

## Meeting
I discussed the problems I was having with the mesh and Barrett suggested I try create a plane in May to stop
the player from falling out of the model he also suggested that jason turn of the automatic colliders in 
unity and implement new colliders for where the under will interact with tan object and perhaps this way he 
could avoid have scenes where the player falls out of the model. Arnaud  and Brett also suggested we review 3 more papers 
before our next meeting on Monday.
