# Week 9

As a continuation of last week's work the bulk of our task was to continue the development of the project Jason and I
spent a few days in the VR room at Caufield exploring ways in which we could implement teleportation in VR we took 
particular interest in this method http://tomhulton.blogspot.com/2015/08/portal-rendering-with-offscreen-render.html. 
We implemented a few navigation however we had a few problems and me and Jason split up the bugs we had and began to 
solve. Although we completed the requested 3 papers for our lit review Jason and felt like we would benefit from adding 
more papers to our lit review progressively so we worked on adding a few more papers to the lit review. To split our 
time Jason and I decided that it would be best if I worked with Jason on the development till end of week 10 then I would
branch off to work more on the final paper and the poster.
