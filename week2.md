#Week 2
This week project allocation were made and I was allocated to the Navigation Virtual reality project where I will be 
working with **Jason Ly** under the supervision of **Dr. Arnaud Prozeau** & **Dr. Barrett Ens**.

#Project Summary:Virtual Reality navigation
Virtual Reality is very convenient for visualisation of 3D models.
However, for large models like 3D models of buildings, navigation can
be quite complex, as physical navigation wonâ€™t be possible. The main aim of this project will be to investigate 
and implement different navigation techniques which will be used to navigate 3D buildings. 

##Meeting

Unfortunately I was unable to attend the first meeting with Jason and Arnaud this week but I did speak to Jason and 
Aranud before and after the meeting and they gave me a brief overview of what was discussed. 

Arnaud suggested we install Unity and learn how to work with unity using C#.He also gave us a link to a web
 demonstration of the 3D scans (meshes) that we would use for our investigation.He also suggested we 
 create a repository for our project using GitBucket or GitHub.  
 
 From the conversations I had with Jason and my supervisors the tasks I had for this week were as follows:
 
 ###Tasks
 [x] Install Unity 
 [x] Play around with unity and understand C#
 [] Plan project specification .
 [x] Preliminary Investigation into Literature.
