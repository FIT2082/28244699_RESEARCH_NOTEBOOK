#Week 1
The main task of this week was the selection of projects that we will be working on over the semester. After a brief 
reading of the available projects I finally decided on choosing the following projects:
 * Visualization for In-Situ Maintenance
 * Navigation in Virtual Reality
 * Teaching Dave English
 
 I felt these 3 projects would allow me not only gain some valuable skills but allow me to also demonstrate the 
 skills I already have.
