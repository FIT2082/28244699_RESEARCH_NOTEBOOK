# Week 5

I spent most of this week working on the Project specification and trying to understand the work Jason had 
already done in Unity. I also read the Literature reviews already done by Jason and he strongly suggested 
I ready the paper on NaviFields which used scaled displacements to adjust the movement speeds of a user allowing 
for greater distances to be travelled.  We also worked on the problems we had with the mesh. Jason I had tried
to find ways of cleaning up the mesh however he was not successful so I decided to have a go while he would work on
implementing basic movement in unity. I initially tried to use Blender to clean up the mesh but I had very little success. 

## Meeting
 
We discussed existing works and literature on the topic. We established that around  20 paper would be a 
broad enough scope for our Literature review. Arnaud suggested we use MeshFilter and MeshLab to try clean up
the mesh. We also submitted a Draft of the project specification to our supervisors.
