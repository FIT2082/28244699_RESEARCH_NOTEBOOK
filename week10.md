# Week 10
In the process of developing the Navigation techniques we encountered more bugs the biggest of these problems  was the 
differences we got when we moved from the VR simulator to the VR headset. I continued working on the poster and the 
paper and adding interesting papers to our literature review.



## Meeting

We discussed how we are going to evaluate the navigation methods we implemented . It was suggested that we use look 
at heuristic evaluation to evaluate our project and this paper 
https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/16/4/831/690829 aid in the planning of our evaluation described heuristic 
evaluation methods for VR and aid us immensely in the planning of our evaluation.
