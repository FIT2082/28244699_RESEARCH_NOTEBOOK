# Week 8

This weeks main task was to get started on implementing Navigation techniques in VR . As instructed by our supervisors 
last week we worked on adding papers to our literature review and discussed them in the meeting. After our meeting we 
were given access to two computers and a HTC Vive Pro which we would use to test out our model. 

## Meeting

We discussed the steps we needed to take to complete the project, and what we had done so far, we discussed 
different navigation techniques we could implement of particular interest was a navigation method whereby the use would 
have a mab in their hands and they could pick a point in the map where they would want to go once they do this  they may 
then teleport to that place. Jason and I decided we would first try implement a way for the user to teleport from one 
place to another and we did not manage to do this task.
