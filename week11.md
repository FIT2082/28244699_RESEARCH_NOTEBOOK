# Week 11

This was the final meeting we had with our supervisors as they were leaving to Europe and they suggested we have drafts 
of our poster and a draft of our paper they could look so this became my priority this week.I began working on the structure 
of the poster and started consulting with Jason about what he felt should be left out from the poster. I the poster and 
sent a draft by the end of the week in hopes of getting a response by next week. We continued to work the problems that 
we had however it felt like as soon as we solved one another one came up. I was unwell for the bulk of this week due to 
an asthma attack so I could not collaborate with Jason as much as intended. 


## Meeting

We discussed ideas as to how we would present specifically what to include they suggested we include less text as our 
project was one that was best described visually. Since we could not set up the Vive pro at the venue we found it best to 
take screen shots which we would include in the poster and screen recording of the navigation techniques.
